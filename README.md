# FocusTime

I developed FocusTime while participating in [Mo Binni's](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/mo-binni/) Complete React Native Developer course at [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/). The design of FocusTime is grounded in the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), a strategy involving concentrated time blocks dedicated to specific tasks or objectives to amplify attention and productivity.

This application served as an opportunity for me to further solidify my React Native proficiency, given my existing experience with the technology. The course acted as a means to reinforce and enhance my skills rather than just an introduction
